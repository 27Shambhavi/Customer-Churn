📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.  
It applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to identify customers who are most likely to leave a service.

## 🚀 Features
- Dataset: **Telco Customer Churn (CSV provided)**
- Preprocessing: handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): churn distribution, correlations, visualizations
- Model Training: classification models to predict churn
- Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/27Shambhavi/Customer-Churn.git
   cd Customer-Churn
📌 Usage

Run all cells in dataset.ipynb.

The notebook will:

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Perform exploratory analysis with plots.

Train classification models.

Evaluate results with metrics.
📊 Example Insights

Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn.

Churn rate is higher among customers with month-to-month contracts.

Additional services (like tech support and online security) correlate with lower churn.

🔮 Future Improvements

Experiment with advanced ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM).

Build a Flask/Streamlit app for real-time churn prediction.

Integrate with business dashboards for decision-making.
